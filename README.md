Terraform Module Versions

Modules, like any piece of code, are never complete. There will always be new module requirements and changes.

Each distinct module address has associated with it a set of versions, each of which has an associated version number. 
Terraform assumes version numbers follow the Semantic Versioning 2.0 convention. Each module block may select a distinct version of a module, 
even if multiple blocks have the same source address.
